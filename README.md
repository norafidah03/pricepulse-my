# PricePulse MY: Malaysia Food Price Intelligence

*Know your prices. Understand your cost of living.*

PricePulse MY tracks everyday food prices across Malaysia using KPDN's PriceCatcher data, published on
[data.gov.my](https://data.gov.my). It answers: how fast are observed food prices changing in each state,
which items are driving it, and how much does the same grocery basket cost from state to state?

> Status: work in progress (milestone 1 of 5: data foundation). See [docs/PLAN.md](docs/PLAN.md).

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m src.pricepulse.fetch      # downloads ~160 MB of monthly PriceCatcher files into data/raw/
python -m src.pricepulse.clean      # one price per shop, item and month -> data/processed/ (~20 s)
pytest
# open notebooks/01_eda.py in VS Code and run the cells
```

## Data sources
- PriceCatcher daily item prices by premise, KPDN via data.gov.my (`storage.data.gov.my/pricecatcher/`), Jan 2022 onwards
- PriceCatcher item and premise lookups (same location)
- Consumer Price Index by state and division, DOSM via OpenDOSM (`cpi_2d_state`), used only to check our numbers

PricePulse reports **observed price changes** in PriceCatcher. These are not official inflation statistics;
DOSM's CPI is shown separately and labelled as such.
